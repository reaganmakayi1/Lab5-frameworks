## Part 1: Bootstrap
- Implemented a responsive navbar using Bootstrap's component system
- Created a two-column layout using Bootstrap's grid system
- Added styled button and alert components
- Observations: Bootstrap provides ready-to-use components that make it quick to build consistent UIs

## Part 2: Tailwind CSS
- Built a responsive card layout using Tailwind's utility classes
- Implemented different grid layouts for different screen sizes
- Added hover effects and transitions
- Observations: Tailwind's utility-first approach offers more flexibility but requires learning many class names

## Part 3: React.js
- Created a component that accepts props (WelcomeMessage)
- Implemented state management with useState hook (ToggleMessage)
- Compared to vanilla JS: React's declarative approach simplifies UI updates
- Observations: React's component model makes code more organized and reusable
